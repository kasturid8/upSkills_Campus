# upskillCampus
A comprehensive project implementing machine learning models for accurate crop and weed detection, enhancing agricultural efficiency through advanced data preprocessing and computer vision techniques.
# Overview
This project implements machine learning models using YOLOv3 to accurately detect crops and weeds in agricultural images, enhancing agricultural efficiency by differentiating between desired plants and unwanted weeds.

# Project Structure
Data: Contains 1300 images of sesame crops and various weeds with YOLO format labels.
Training: Scripts and notebooks for training the YOLOv3 model.
Detection: Scripts and notebooks for performing detection using the pre-trained model.
Models: Pre-trained model weights for detection.
Results: Output images and evaluation metrics showcasing model performance.


This project showcases the integration of advanced machine learning techniques to solve real-world agricultural challenges, enhancing crop yield and farming efficiency.
